# Welcome to Movies Challenge!

Hi, these is a services to see all movies from the best platforms as Netflix, Prime Video and Disney Plus.
You can Get, Create, Update and Delete a movie.
This service is developed in AWS SAM.

With these steps, you can get this service on your local machine.


# Prerequisite

You must install SAM CLI in your machine.

Install for **MAC** or **Linux** SAM CLI using Brew

    $~ brew tap aws/tap
    $~ brew tap aws/tap


Install for **Windows**  SAM CLI using an MSI

 - For SO [64 bit](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli/releases/latest/download/AWS_SAM_CLI_64_PY3.msi)


Requires Docker and the AWS CLI. You can to see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) how

## Get Started

After that you installed the SAM CLI, you can clone the repository.

    git clone https://github.com/ivanojgarcia/movies-challenge.git

Now we enter the folder **movies-challenge** and after that the service folder **ms-movies**

    $~ cd movies-challenge
    $~ cd ms-movies
We install the node modules

    $~ npm install

With this you have to install the service in your machine.

## Import Data Dummy for tests

This services have a method or script for create the databases, tables and inject data for initial functionality.
It's possible thank to Sequelize ORM, installed in our services. For this is necessary execute the next commands:

> **Note**: You must be into the folder or directory **ms-movies** to make it work

Before execute the commands, you must configure the config.json file, this file has in the next route **movies-challenge/ms-movies/config/config.json**, with this configuration you can run the services in your local machine.

You can to take this example Json:
  

      {
	    "development": {
		    "username": "yapp-user-challenge",
		    "password": "yappChallenge",
		    "database": "yapp-app",
		    "host": "127.0.0.1",
		    "port": "3306",
		    "dialect": "mysql"
	    },
	    "test": {
		    "username": "yapp-user-challenge",
		    "password": "yappChallenge",
		    "database": "yapp-app",
		    "host": "127.0.0.1",
		    "port": "3306",
		    "dialect": "mysql"
	    },
	    "production": {
		    "username": "yapp-user-challenge",
		    "password": "yappChallenge",
		    "database": "yapp-app",
		    "host": "127.0.0.1",
		    "port": "3306",
		    "dialect": "mysql"
	    }
    }

 

> **Important:** You must to change the values **username**, **password**, **host** and **port** by your values or information of Database,.
> You can leave the name of the DB, this is because the scripts created it for you.

All is ready for start and execute the scripts

**For create our DB:**

    $~ npm run create:db
**For create tables:** 

    $~ npm run migrate

**For inject data:**

    $~ npm run seed:all

Congratulations you are ready for start!

## Configure the service for run in your local machine

SAM needs docker to be able to run locally.

Since it uses docker images, we must point our database host towards the DNS of our image. For this, after having started the database (Creation of tables, databases and records) we will change in our config.json file the value of the host for this host.docker.internal

For this you must change in your config.json the host **127.0.0.1** by **host.docker.internal**, with this, the image docker can it connect with your local DB.

Look the example:

        "development": {
		    "username": "yapp-user-challenge",
		    "password": "yappChallenge",
		    "database": "yapp-app",
		    "host": "host.docker.internal",
		    "port": "8889",
		    "dialect": "mysql"
	    }

## Run the SAM AWS Local

For run our services, we must to run the next command, but before, we enter the folder or directory **movies-challenge** in this folder found the **template.yaml** file.

Run the next command `sam local start-api --port 4000` for avoid problems with the **port** add the flag `--port 4000` with is the APIs run in this port.

If you have no problems, you can see something like this:

       âžœ  movies-challenge git:(master) sam local start-api --port 4000

    You can now browse to the above endpoints to invoke your functions. You do not need to restart/reload SAM CLI while working on your functions, changes will be reflected instantly/automatically. You only need to restart SAM CLI if you update your AWS SAM template
